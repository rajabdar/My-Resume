            <h3>Tidy Town</h3>
            <p>Final year Project</p>
            <p>
                An IoT based smart waste management system that uses smart bins to monitor the waste
                levels. Upon filling to the maximum level, the smart bin updates the central system and a
                garbage collector is assigned the duty to empty the bin. Cameras over the smart bins are used
                to detect garbage thrown outside the bin and identify the person who threw the garbage, 
                so that appropriate action can be taken.
